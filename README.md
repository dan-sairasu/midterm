## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

components: backend, admin, client, and utilities, each serving distinct roles in the overall architecture.

## Integration
### Client Integration
The client is integrated to the backend REST API using Javascript to receive data from the API and translate the data to the front-end
The client retrieves data through AJAX calls to the backend API endpoints, ensuring a seamless user experience by dynamically updating the UI based on user interactions.

### Admin Integration
The Admin is integrated with the backend REST API to manage packages and user permissions, allowing administrators to perform CRUD operations on the packages efficiently.
The Admin interface allows for comprehensive oversight of the system, enabling data management like adding new data.

## Choice of Language
The choice of programming languages for this project includes Python for the backend due to its robust frameworks and libraries, and JavaScript for the client-side to ensure dynamic and interactive user experiences for its versatility and wide adaption in web development. And since the Fornt-end is built using PHP and Bootstrap framework. Additionaly, I'm using Java for the language Interoperability
